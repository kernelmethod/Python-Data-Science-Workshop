    "In recent years, Python has become a popular programming language for machine learning for a few reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Python is a high-level language, and fairly easy to learn\n",
    "* It's relatively easy to integrate with low-level languages like C and Fortran, which can make well-written Python code run extremely quickly.\n",
    "* Python already had a lot of great libraries for data visualization and manipulation, like pandas and matplotlib\n",
    "\n",
    "Most cutting-edge, high-performance machine learning libraries have a Python interface. In this workshop, we're going to talk about one such library, [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org). Scikit-learn is a toolbox with dozens upon dozens of the most popular algorithms for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. In addition, it contains utilities for cleaning up data and preparing it for machine learning.\n",

    "We're going to use a subset of the [Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) dataset](http://vis-www.cs.umass.edu/lfw/) to demonstrate how to use scikit-learn. Our data includes about 1,300 grayscale images of seven individuals. Run the code cell below to download the data and show a few of the images in the dataset. \n",

    "In this notebook, I'm going to show you how to use machine learning to recognize faces of people from the LFW data. By the end, you'll have a full-fledged machine learning system that can automatically classify these images by who they belong to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our first step will be to understand [support vector machines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Support_vector_machine) (SVMs). Support vector machines are a powerful tool for classifying data, and have the benefit of being fairly simple to use. First we consider *linear SVMs*. Given a dataset and two classes (e.g. \"red points\" and \"blue points\", or \"image of Colin Powell\" and \"not an image of Colin Powell\"), a linear SVM attempts to draw a line (or, in higher dimensions, a hyperplane) between points in the two classes. This line is called the *decision boundary*, and all points on one side are said to be in the first class while the points on the other side are predicted to be in the second class.\n",

    "\n",
    "An SVM doesn't just pick any line between the two classes; it tries to find the line that is furthest from the data on each side. For datasets that are not separable (i.e. datasets where there doesn't exist a line that exactly separates the two classes), we make a tradeoff that is controlled by a hyperparameter $C$ that we choose. If $C$ is large, the SVM does its best to accurately classify points in both classes, but the line may have to get extremely close to both datasets. On the other hand, if $C$ is small, then we allow the SVM to make mistakes and misclassify some of the datapoints, but in return we get a decision boundary that cleanly splits the classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "A more sophisticated type of support vector machine is a *nonlinear SVM* (also called a kernel SVM or kernel machine). A kernel machine does the same thing as a linear SVM, but, using some fancy mathematics and a *kernel function*, allows for a more complicated decision boundary.\n",

    "\n",
    "Try changing `C` in the code below to see how it can affect your decision boundary. As you'll see, at `C = 1` the decision boundary looks fairly reasonable, cleanly separating the blob and crescent pieces. When `C` becomes too small the support vector machine chooses the \"simplest\" boundary possible; in fact, for `C` sufficiently small it'll just put every data point in the same class. At the other extreme, if you make `C` very large then your SVM will try to find an extremely convoluted decision boundary in order to accurately classify every point. That might get you great accuracy on the data you're training on, but in real life your machine learning system has to deal with data points it's never seen before. If your decision boundary is too complicated then you're more likely to incorrectly classify those data points."

    "```python\n",
    "from sklearn.svm import SVC\n",
    "```\n",
    "2. We then create an `SVC` object, and give some parameters. For instance, `C` is the hyperparameter $C$ that affects how \"clean\" our decision boundary is.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "clf = SVC(C=1, kernel='rbf', gamma='scale')\n",
    "```\n",
    "  `kernel='rbf'` tells scikit-learn that we want to use the [radial basis function kernel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radial_basis_function_kernel), a popular kernel function for support vector machines. `gamma='scale'` causes `sklearn` to automatically choose a parameter $\\gamma$ that is required by the RBF kernel.\n",
    "3. We now call `fit` with the data we want to use to train the support vector machine:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "clf.fit(X,y) # X = dataset, y = classes\n",
    "```\n",
    "4. Now our support vector machine has been trained! We can make predictions using the `predict` function. For instance, if we want to classify some data stored in the variable `Z`, we run\n",

We're going to use scikit-learn's `train_test_split` function to put $85\\%$ of the data into a \"training set\" and the remaining $15\\%$ into a \"testing set\". We'll train the support vector machine on the training set and then see how well it does on the test set, which it won't be trained on. As we'll see, it will do much better at classifying faces from the training set than faces from the test set."

Then we loop over the folds: we repeatedly hold one fold out, and train on the remaining $k - 1$ folds.
